The guiding principles articulated in this plan—Decolonization, Diversity and Equity, Sustainability, Valuing Faculty, Interdisciplinarity, and Health and Wellness—continued to permeate our thinking as we co-designed the University’s future.</p>\n        <h3 ref=\"building-success\" class=\"anchor\">Building on our past successes</h3>\n        <p>The past five years have been transformational for OCAD University. We have made significant impacts under the previous Academic Plan’s guiding principles and as a result, the University has transformed into a leader in diversity for higher education.</p>\n        <p>The first principle of our previous Academic Plan, Decolonization, sought to ensure that “the multiplicity of histories and perspectives of racialized and Indigenous students, faculty and staff are recognized and affirmed in their experience at the institution.” This principle, in conjunction with the goals of the first priority, <em>Indigenous Learning: Nothing About Us Without Us</em>, created an infrastructure for the transformation we are continuing in this Academic and Strategic Plan.</p>\n        <p>Through a rigorous approach to hiring from 2017 to 2022, we are closer to seeing our faculty reflect the breadth of identities of our students. In tandem, and as disciplinary porosity has been embraced, the curriculum in our programs has been transformed to include global histories and cultures. Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers have guided the process to develop a Wholistic Approach to Curriculum, and they will continue to provide us with guidance to integrate Indigenous Knowledge into course content.</p>\n        <p>Our pandemic-led pivot to online and flexible learning modes demonstrated the resilience and creativity of faculty, staff, technicians, scholars, designers and artists at the University. As a result, we have seen significant innovations in the delivery of art and design education. Structural transformation of our curriculum through the <a href=\"https://www.ocadu.ca/about/governance/VP-academic-and-provost/flow-curricular-transformation\">process known as Flow</a> enables students to take more electives outside of their major program thereby creating a more interdisciplinary and enriched student experience and a more sustainable model for art and design education. Embracing change to this extent has been transformational for our community. Consequently, we are well positioned to undertake the work to ensure the success of this new plan. </p>\n        <h3 ref=\"moving-forward\" class=\"anchor\">Moving forward with purpose</h3>\n        <p>As the world continues to undergo an unprecedented series of economic, social, environmental and technological transformations, this integrated plan aims to create a vision for resilience and flourishing—for our students, the University, and the communities (land, waters and territories) of which they are a part.</p>\n        <p>We remain committed to developing our digital infrastructure and ensuring our students are conversant in technological advances in their respective fields. We will prioritize equity and inclusion in the learning environment and continue to transform not only studio-based pedagogy at OCAD U, but also the spaces in which we experiment and create. </p>\n        <p>The times we live in demand nimble and critical thinking. Our interdisciplinary approach to learning, with increased opportunities for students to add breadth to their knowledge, will amplify the versatility of their degrees and ability to respond to the big questions of the 21st century.</p>\n        <p>We anticipate students will expand their knowledge through improved student mobility and international opportunities. We envisage more external engagement through additional institutional and industry partnerships. Our School of Continuing Studies has grown significantly through the addition of online courses and certificates, encouraging an expansion of our community of learners nationally and internationally.</p>\n        <p>As a University, we remain committed to advancing responsible environmental practices and promoting sustainability through our academic and administrative programs. This integrated plan underscores this work via the Global Centre for Climate Action at Canada’s Malting Silos on Toronto’s waterfront.</p>\n        <p>We will work collaboratively to demonstrate how advances in art and design can intersect with other fields to mitigate the climate crisis, as well as other societal needs. Research will play a key component in this work. OCAD U was instrumental in advancing Design as a field of study recognized by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and we will continue to change the landscape of research to demonstrate the importance of art and design in understanding the problems of our time.</p>\n        <p>Our application of art and design thinking and methods across the various fields of science, health, technological invention, history, strategic foresight, philosophy, and curatorial studies is what makes OCAD U a unique institution of study for students preparing themselves for careers in a society in flux.</p>\n        <p>We’re excited and energized by the creative possibilities and opportunities for collaboration, innovation and experimentation that will emerge as we implement this plan—one that will ultimately drive positive impact by advancing access, equity, justice and sustainability.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"sidenav\">\n        <nav class=\"panel red\">\n          <ul>\n            <li><a @click=\"scrollToAnchorPoint('introduction')\">Our Shared Vision</a></li>\n            <li><a @click=\"scrollToAnchorPoint('building-success')\">Building on our past successes</a></li>\n            <li><a @click=\"scrollToAnchorPoint('moving-forward')\">Moving forward with purpose</a></li>\n          </ul> \n        </nav>  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport HeaderAnimation from '@/assets/lottie/gh1.json'\nimport methods from '@/assets/js/methods'\n\nimport { store } from '@/assets/js/store.js'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n  },\n  methods: {\n    scrollToAnchorPoint(refName) {\n      const el = this.$refs[refName]\n      el.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      store,\n      HeaderAnimation,\n    }\n  },\n  created() {\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.addCircleStrokes = methods.addCircleStrokes()\n  },\n}\n</script> \n  \n<style scoped lang=\"scss\">\n\n</style>","import { render } from \"./IntroductionView.vue?vue&type=template&id=6382ecd0\"\nimport script from \"./IntroductionView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./IntroductionView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/Users/nicolevella/Sites/ocadu-asp/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","ref","_createElementVNode","href","target","_hoisted_3","_createVNode","_component_Vue3Lottie","autoPlay","$data","playState","animationData","pauseAnimation","_hoisted_7","_hoisted_8","_hoisted_9","_hoisted_10","_hoisted_12","_hoisted_13","_hoisted_14","_hoisted_15","_hoisted_17","_hoisted_18","_hoisted_19","_hoisted_20","_hoisted_21","_hoisted_22","_hoisted_23","_hoisted_24","onClick","$options","components","methods","scrollToAnchorPoint","refName","el","this","$refs","scrollIntoView","behavior","data","store","HeaderAnimation","created","mounted","addCircleStrokes","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
