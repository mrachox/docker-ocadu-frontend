OCAD U provides students with opportunities to discover and explore who they are and where they come from, and to build a strong sense of identity to contribute towards a healthy society and a promising future for all people.</p>\n      <p>I am pleased that the establishment of an Elder’s Counsel is a priority for the Indigenous Education Council for OCAD U. The involvement of Elders and Knowledge Keepers from the Indigenous community is essential to providing meaningful guidance to support the work that is required from faculty to help students become more aware of our shared history in Canada. The sharing of Indigenous Knowledge strengthens the healing movement of Indigenous Peoples and a favourable outlook to celebrate diversity and equality through the recognition of the Truth and Reconciliation efforts throughout the region and the country.</p>\n      <p>I would also like to acknowledge the commitment to financial sustainability and the dedication to embrace and uphold Indigenous perspectives through advocacy, creativity and continuous investment at OCAD U. I offer my best wishes to the leadership and faculty to gain the results that are set out in the Academic and Strategic Plan. May your wisdom and love be your most fundamental guiding principles along with respect, bravery, honesty, humility and truth to enhance and further develop the efforts for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students to indefinitely value the wonders of art and design found in all aspects of life.</p>\n      <p>Miigwech and I look forward to ongoing celebration of the Indigenous learning experience that is taking place at OCAD U.</p>\n      <h5 class=\"anchor\">About Elder Elizabeth (Liz) Osawamick</h5>\n      <p>Elizabeth (Liz) Osawamick is an Anishinaabe Midewiwin-kwe community leader, Water Walker/activist, jingle dress dancer, devoted parent and professional teacher.
