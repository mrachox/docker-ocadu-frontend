Developing this integrated plan was a collaborative initiative led by the Academic Planning and Strategic Planning committees.</p>\n        <p>The previous <a href=\"https://www.ocadu.ca/Assets/content/governance/Academic-Plan-2017.pdf\">Academic Plan (2017-2022)</a> presented the guiding principles of decolonization, diversity and equity, sustainability, valuing faculty, interdisciplinarity, and health and wellness. In looking to the future, we believed these principles continued to be important and should be honoured in the process of developing a new Academic and Strategic Plan.</p>\n        <p>As a result, we designed our planning approach to embody and express these guiding principles, identified in the core design principles found below.</p>\n\n        <h3 ref=\"core-design\" class=\"anchor\">Core design principles</h3>\n        <h4>Co-creative</h4>\n        <p>Reflecting the collective intelligence of such a diverse community with many disciplines required us to shift each step of engagement from extractive consultation to creative co-development. This meant that at each stage, stakeholders were asked to imagine and create the solutions that would excite them.</p>\n        <h4>Open and transparent</h4>\n        <p>To honour the creations, efforts, energy and inputs of each group that contributed, while also maintaining the agency of other stakeholders throughout the process to add, evolve, debate and adapt, we sought to keep all inputs, steps, assumptions and products visible and available throughout the process so provenance was clear.</p>\n        <h4>Iterative</h4>\n        <p>This transparency allowed for an iterative process; one in which products of increasing fidelity could be produced and engaged with repeatedly.</p>\n        <h4>Context aware</h4>\n        <p>By leveraging the perspectives of each stakeholder group and shifting our deliberative lens, we built our plans with a view not only to changes in the outside world and our place within it, but also the views and experiences of our community members.</p>\n        <h4>Technology-enabled, but dialogue-driven</h4>\n        <p>Multi-stakeholder dialogue was seen as the single, driving force in the process but we used technology to enrich that dialogue through broad data collection, analysis and visualization. This enabled us to find points of contention, convergence and to assist in pattern recognition and transparency. Visual repositories, survey tools, data graphing and deliberative wiki-surveys all helped to keep the dialogues connected, inclusive and informed.</p>\n\n        <h3 ref=\"process\" class=\"anchor\">Process</h3>\n        <!-- <p>The previous Academic Plan (2017-2022) presented the guiding principles of decolonization, diversity and equity, sustainability, valuing faculty, interdisciplinarity, and health and wellness. In looking to the future, we believed these principles continued to be important and should be honoured in the process of developing a new Academic and Strategic Plan.</p> -->\n        <p>The combined Academic and Strategic Planning process began in September of 2021 with a questionnaire sent to all members of the University community asking for input on both the priorities of the community, and the issues and context they felt a plan should consider.</p>\n        <p>The results of the questionnaire were analyzed and categorized, then prioritized through voting by the Academic and Strategic Planning committees. Through a series of collaborative design sessions held in the fall of 2021, the committees imagined ways of addressing the emerging priorities and discussed issues they felt the University could impact through its collective work.</p>\n        <p>As priority areas emerged from these early collaborative sessions, stakeholder groups across the University community were engaged to further develop and contribute to the thematic areas, following the principle of designing <em>with</em> instead of <em>for</em> groups within the University. </p>\n        <p>By December 2021, with a stable set of priorities having been developed, working groups pushed them to greater detail, and they were challenged, stress tested and iterated through an extensive round of collaborative sessions. </p>\n        <p>In order to translate the priorities into measurable objectives, unit heads across the University were polled to ascertain where work and energy were currently aligning with the priorities of the plan. This was then evaluated through a series of dialogues with the Board of Governors, Senate and Committees to accommodate their visions for those priority areas.</p>\n        <p>The final plan expressed a shared Vision and Mission as well as a set of Priorities. These were presented for approval to governing bodies who had been invited to contribute at each stage in the process of the plan’s development.</p>\n      \n        <h3 ref=\"format\" class=\"anchor\">Format of consultations</h3>\n        <p>Between November 2021 and May 2022,  the University engaged the OCAD U community in more than 30 facilitated consultation sessions to solicit input on the University’s next Academic and Strategic Plan, including multiple opportunities to attended regular President’s Idea Café sessions.</p>\n        <h4>Sessions involved</h4>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Board of Governors (5)</li>\n          <li>Senate (5)</li>\n          <li>Joint Board-Senate Liaison Subcommittee (2)</li>\n          <li>Faculty and staff</li>\n          <li>Student Townhall</li>\n          <li>Faculty and Curriculum Development Centre</li>\n          <li>International students</li>\n          <li>Indigenous Students’ Association (2)</li>\n          <li>Indigenous Education Council (2)</li>\n          <li>Student peer mentors, student group leaders and Student Union</li>\n          <li>ODESI Accessibility Committee</li>\n          <li>ODESI Sustainability Committee</li>\n          <li>ODESI Equity Committee</li>\n          <li>Graduate Student Caucus</li>\n          <li>Small group: former/current Board members</li>\n          <li>Industry partners</li>\n          <li>OCAD U CO and Inclusive Design Research Centre Session</li>\n          <li>Sessional faculty</li>\n          <li>Senior Leadership Team</li>\n          <li>Management Group</li>\n          <li>Small group: alumni</li>\n          <li>Student leadership award winners</li>\n          <li>Indigenous faculty consultation</li>\n          <li>Multi-stakeholder group</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h4>Surveys</h4>\n        <ul>\n          <li>1 general questionnaire – October 1 to October 15, 2022</li>\n          <li>1 alumni survey – February 23 to March 9, 2022</li>\n          <li>1 unit heads survey – March 7 to 14, 2022</li>\n          <li>1 sessional faculty survey – April 4 to April 11, 2022</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h4>President’s Idea Cafés</h4>\n        <p>10 bi-weekly open meetings with the OCAD U community were held from November 29, 2021 to April 25, 2022<br />&nbsp;</p>\n        <h4>Written Submissions</h4>\n        <p>Five written submissions were received from groups and individuals, in addition to the OCAD U community’s contributions to the Miro Board.</p>\n\n        <h5 ref=\"commitee-members\" class=\"anchor\">Committee Members</h5>\n        <h3>Academic Planning Committee Members</h3>\n        <p>September 2021 to May 2022</p>\n        <ul class=\"columns\">\n          <li><strong>Dr. Caroline Langill</strong>Vice-President, Academic and Provost (Chair of the Committee)</li>\n          <li><strong>Deanne Fisher</strong>Vice-Provost, Students and International</li>\n          <li><strong>Dr. Ashok Mathur</strong>Interim Vice-President, Research &amp;
