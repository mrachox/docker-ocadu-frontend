<h5>Creative Resilience, Resilient Creativity features work by 20 emerging artists who explore themes of community, innovation, intimacy, resilience and isolation, drawing upon their lived experience during the pandemic. The exhibition is presented by OCAD University Chancellor Jamie Watt.</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pandemic presented a unique environment to create in a time and space like never before. This new free, public exhibition presents works that express a range of what it meant to create during a pandemic – from themes that include profound loneliness and isolation, resiliency, innovation and experimentation.</p>

<p>The exhibition builds on the success of OCAD U’s recent <a href="https://eportfolio.ocadu.ca/medalwinner/index/daf2caa1-26dd-4f93-8295-a72ec8a4dfbe">GradEx 107</a> and features 20 artists from the last three OCAD U graduate exhibitions. The exhibition is free and opens to the public on Thursday, June 9 at 6 p.m. in the lobby of First Canadian Place at 100 King Street West. Sponsored by Brookfield Properties and Navigator, works will be on display until June 24.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Curatorial Message From Marilyn Adlington</h5>

<p>In partnership with OCAD U Grad Ex, Creative Resilience/Resilient Creativity: Chancellor Jaime Watt’s Gallery surveys the many ways that living through a pandemic warps our experience of time and space. Historically, the work of artists has been a consistent guide through times of strife and devastation, providing glimmers of connection, hope, and perhaps even joy, amidst dark and challenging realities. This exhibition brings together twenty artists selected for their capacity to spark reflection and respect for the collective grief shared amongst the masses, shedding light on the breadth of insight and inspiration that has been consistently demonstrated by OCAD University graduates over the past three years.</p>

<p>In medium or message, each artist featured in Creative Resilience/Resilient Creativity engages themes that respond to the conditions of the pandemic, spanning sentiments of loneliness and sorrow as well as surprise and longing. While some address the pandemic through the depiction of domestic spaces and shifted routines of care, others engage the experience through the materials they use. In many cases, the shifts in their artistic practice results in unique and experimental work that challenges notions of genre and artistic discipline by instead celebrating the innovative creativity that comes out of such resilience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the collection features a multifaceted perspective that is enriched by its distinctive modes of address. Together, the artworks featured in Creative Resilience/Resilient Creativity present an attempt to encapsulate many realties that the pandemic has forced upon us. Because each artwork has a story that is inspired by the same event, the exhibition becomes a vessel for collective storytelling and a form of community connection. The breath of experiences throughout the past three years are worth documenting as a cultural record that demonstrates how resilience and creativity mutually reinforce one another. As both a cultural snapshot and philosophical meditation, Creative Resilience/Resilient Creativity offers a thoughtful compendium of artwork about the pandemic that demonstrates how we may all be encouraged to dream differently in this new world.</p>

<div data-artwork-details="">Documented performance</div>
<div data-artwork-details="">Program: Drawing & Painting</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">My artistic process is heavily intertwined with my day to day life; shifting, adapting and hardly resisting big life situations that influence my mental and physical state. Rooted in a personal work of mourning, I explore connections between grief and indifference. I invite a nihilistic approach as a rather positive framework for these experiences, giving meaninglessness meaning and significance. I emphasize the need for compassion toward collective grief surrounding the human condition, environmental distress and day to day exhaustion in relation to the mundanity of life through the ephemeral effects of abstract drawings, performances and public interventions. A desire for direction, order, balance as well a curiosity toward spirituality are themes that are frequent in my work.</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">Kim's works scrutinize the idea of gratitude on mundanity, delivering a sense of picturesque happiness—a celebration of a tedious moment. She explores simple, flat forms to encompass expressive, whimsical, calm, and joyous moments with her vibrant and pastel colour palettes. Her art practice is instinctive, schematic, and almost childlike, represented by her simplified yet precise forms, shapes, and lines. To the simplification and abstraction in her art-making, Kim adds soft colours to bring a sense of tranquillity and vibrant colours to deliver a sense of energy and power. She shares her genuine gratitude for life and surrenders contemplation and tension, exploring the idea of family, home, and nature. Her works are an outlet of comfort, an undemanding space of serenity.</div>

<div data-artwork-details="">Oil painting on canvas</div>
<div data-artwork-details="">Program: Drawing & Painting</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">The importance of this painting falls on the context of the story behind it. From the first time I saw the Cirque Du Soleil show – Corteo, I was drawn to this character. Little did I know at the time I would end up spending a year watching this very show 3-4 times a week. No matter how many times I watched it, the "White Clown" never seized to mesmerize me, holding my gaze in every act. For the White Clown, appearances are what matters most. He is an authority figure that represents tradition and order. Of all the colourful characters, he admires only the stars and scorns the others. He is the one who opens the door to the magic of the circus. Off stage was when the human behind the character of the white clown reviled himself. Marcello radiated love, sympathy, hope, and joy. In this painting my intentionality was to mould Marcello and White Clown’s personalities together, becoming a proper, yet kind-eyed clown while exposing his authentic humanity.</div>

<div data-artist-bio="">Leah Probst is a Toronto-based artist, where she completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts at Ontario College of Art and Design University. Working mainly in the traditional medium of oil paint on canvas, she also works in Acrylic and soft pastel. Her subject matter is strongly figurative and portrait-based. Her paintings are comprehensible and recognizable, consisting of vibrant figures that come alive and seem to leap off the canvas. Probst believes that each viewer should be able to take away a unique experience shared with the work of art. Probst conveys clarity and honesty to the portrait, inviting the viewer to appreciate the fundamentals of the subject. She reveal the individual, looking beyond the surface toward the human condition with empathy to the personal connection she has with each subject. The evident slowness in her paintings acknowledge attention paid to the layering of information, built-up levels of paint, and a complexity of mixed colours which bring the paintings to life.</div>

The Quarantine period was incredibly difficult and challenging for everyone involved, so as a creative, I wanted to work towards creating a piece that had a sense of community, inclusivity, and joy.</div>

<div data-artist-bio="">I’m Michael! I’m a queer, Toronto-based illustrator always looking for new challenges, new projects, and new opportunities. I’m a mixed-media artist, I would be lying if I said I had a specific way of working, but lately I’ve been working in a cut paper/ digital mash-up. I have years of professional experience using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Procreate. I've done work for independent publications, art review journals, and as an Image Post-Production Technician.</div>

<div data-artist-bio="">As a Hamilton-based artist, I feel it is important to understand class distinctions in our urban spaces; how our environments are a reflection of how our economy treats us. Growing up with an immigrant mother and a school teacher father, I’ve learned the significance in teaching, helping, and understanding each other rather than to be combative with bias. Art is a great tool for this, as it connects us through stimulating visual empathy. Having difficulty speaking at a young age, drawing was my preferred way of communicating and the start of my therapeutic relationship to art. Experiencing mental illness myself and with those close to me, I find it easier to put emotions into abstracted visual art. Primarily an oil painter, as well as practicing ballet, photography, film, music and collage, I’ve come to appreciate different forms of expression as its own performative language.</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">"Our Little Hideaway" - based on the subreddit community r/secretcompartments, enthusiasts of creating hidden spaces. The members of this group cohabit their dream living space (which of course, happens to be filled with hidden compartments). This painting is apart of Brian Jiang's graduating thesis series, “CU IRL”, which imagines how niche online interest groups would navigate social dynamics if they inhabited speculative worlds of their own, safe from the public scrutiny of real life. The series depicts how the internet is reshaping notions of what community and social spheres should look like.</div>

<div data-artwork-details="">Program: Drawing & Painting</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">With my art, I aim to express my complex identity as an immigrant, a minority, and an Asian female in an interracial marriage. This painting was inspired by my dreams. Using my subconscious, I try to navigate the relationship between my Korean identity and Canadian surroundings. Even though dreams are illogical and nonsensical, they help me catch a glimpse of my feelings about the experiences in my new surroundings.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the process of making art, trying to composing each of the elements in harmony. I believe that not knowing the outcome is a key to make the process more fun and enjoyable. This positive attitude toward the uncertainty is revealed in my painting.</div>

<div data-artist-bio="">Heejae Jo was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1987. Having an interest in learning how people acquire emotion and their patterns of behavior, she studied Educational Psychology at Sookmyung Women’s University. Attending a women’s school also gave a great impact on her feministic perception.<br />
<br />
Studying abnormal psychology in university, she has been questioning the boundaries between normal and abnormal. In her art, she likes to experiment with what we believe is normal—tradition, universal value, and rational ways of thinking.</div>

<div data-artwork-details="">Acrylic and mixed media painting on canvas</div>
<div data-artwork-details="">Program: Drawing & Painting</div>

<div data-artwork-description="">My large scale abstract acrylic paintings use colour, line, and organic form to release emotions and create a colour field that soothes and disturbs the eye. My work materializes the visual impact of light as it interacts within an environment. The boldness of abstract expressionist women that came before me inspired my drive to create unapologetically and with vigour. My abstract expressionist pieces, while extremely personal, are also intensely reliant upon the viewer. The emotions that my pieces evoke are more important to me than the content behind them. The therapeutic release that painting grants is something I desire to give back to the viewer as they experience the harmony of colour and brushstrokes in my work.</div>

<div data-artist-bio="">My name is Sarah Dufresne and I am an abstract expressionist artist from Thunder Bay, Ontario. I have successfully participated in 2 collaborative art exhibits, one being with my father, Guy Dufresne, and 3 solo art exhibits. In Thunder Bay while attending Lakehead University completing my HBA in Psychology, I took some painting and drawing courses in order to cope with the stressors of University and young adulthood. That led me to be showcased in their yearly juried art show (2016 &amp; 2017), which started my experiences of gallery showing</div>
